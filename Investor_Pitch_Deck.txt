Investor Pitch Deck - MindWhisper AI (Free Cluely)
Date: 2025-09-20

—
Slide 1 — Title
• MindWhisper AI: The Invisible Meeting Copilot
• Private, real-time intelligence for calls and meetings
• Live Mode: flags questionable commands and answers instantly
• Prototype live; seeking investment to scale to GA

Speaker Notes:
MindWhisper AI (formerly Free Cluely) is an invisible desktop meeting copilot. It listens to your meetings privately, extracts key actions, and augments your workflow without joining as a visible participant. Our signature feature, Live Mode, detects questionable commands in real time and answers them at near‑instant speed. We’re at prototype today with strong product proof points and are raising to scale to general availability.

—
Slide 2 — The Problem
• Knowledge loss and follow‑up chaos after meetings
• Assistants that “join calls” erode privacy and trust
• Fragmented tooling across Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.
• On‑device performance and latency challenges

Speaker Notes:
Teams lose critical insights after calls. Existing AI assistants frequently join as bots, creating friction and privacy concerns. Tooling is fragmented per meeting platform, and most solutions struggle with latency and accuracy, especially on-device.

—
Slide 3 — Our Solution
• An invisible, cross-platform desktop copilot that:
  – Privately captures all meeting audio (every participant) without joining as a bot
  – Transcribes in real time with adaptive AI
  – Extracts actions, decisions, risks, and commitments
  – Surfaces insights in a premium, distraction-free UI
• Privacy-first: runs locally by default with optional cloud models

Speaker Notes:
We capture what your computer already plays, transcribe in real time, and extract actionable insights. Live Mode flags questionable commands as they occur and answers them instantly. It’s invisible, private by default, and works with any meeting platform.

—
Slide 4 — Why Now
• AI meeting assistants hit product-market interest, but trust is low
• On-device models have reached usable latency for live transcription
• Enterprises demand privacy-by-default with optional cloud augmentation
• Macroeconomic pressure for productivity tooling that truly reduces overhead

Speaker Notes:
We sit at the intersection of maturity in on-device AI, enterprise privacy needs, and rising expectations for meeting productivity.

—
Slide 5 — Product Demo (Prototype Status)
• Live: Real-time transcription of all participants (no visible bot)
• Live Mode: Detects questionable commands and answers instantly in-stream
• Command Extraction: Action items, follow-ups, decisions in-stream
• Premium UI: Modern glassmorphism, keyboard-first, stealth workflow

Speaker Notes:
Our prototype is functional: end-to-end capture, transcription, Live Mode responses, and intelligent extraction with a production-grade, premium UI system. It runs today and supports both local and cloud engines for flexibility.

—
Slide 6 — Key Features
• Live Mode: Flags questionable commands and answers instantly during the meeting

Slide 9 — Market Opportunity
• Target Users: Knowledge workers, sales, customer success, product, recruiting
• Initial ICP: SMB/SME teams adopting AI productivity and privacy tooling
• TAM/SAM/SOM (est.):
  – TAM: >$20B AI work assistant market
  – SAM: ~$5B meeting intelligence subset
  – SOM (entry): Focused verticals with privacy constraints (regulated industries)

Speaker Notes:
Meeting intelligence is large and growing. Our wedge: truly private, invisible capture with enterprise-friendly controls.

—
Slide 10 — Competitive Landscape
• Multi-million-dollar incumbents: Join as visible participants; privacy gaps; platform lock‑in
• Browser Extensions: Limited capture fidelity, fragile to platform changes
• Recording Tools: Great capture, weak on real-time intelligence and actionability
• MindWhisper AI (Cluely): Invisible, cross‑platform, privacy‑first; Live Mode answers questionable commands instantly

Speaker Notes:
We outperform multi‑million‑dollar incumbents on trust (invisible, private), responsiveness (Live Mode), and UX polish. Our capture method avoids joining calls and just works across platforms.

—
Slide 11 — Moat and Defensibility
• Stealth OS-level capture + adaptive inference pipeline
• Enterprise-grade privacy posture: local-first with optional cloud augmentation
• UI/UX excellence that drives adoption and retention
• Data network effects: Structured action/decision datasets over time (customer-owned)

Speaker Notes:
Our defensibility comes from the combination of OS-level capabilities, flexible AI routing, and an interface people will actually use daily. Over time, we build structured insight datasets (under customer control) that improve outcomes.

—
Slide 12 — Business Model
• Plans:
  – Free tier: Local-only transcription (usage caps)
  – Pro: Unlimited local, optional cloud minutes
  – Team: Centralized controls, SSO, shared libraries, priority support
  – Enterprise: Compliance (SOC2), retention, admin policies, audit trails
• Add-ons: Custom on-prem models, compliance tooling, prioritized speech engines

Speaker Notes:
Tiered SaaS with optional metered minutes for cloud engines. Teams and enterprise monetize well through controls, compliance, and support.

—
Slide 13 — Go-To-Market
• Bottom-up: Individual professionals via simple install and instant value
• Product-led growth: Shareable insights, templates, and action summaries
• Partnerships: VARs and MSPs servicing regulated industries
• Enterprise motion: Security reviews, pilots, and compliance roadmaps

Speaker Notes:
Start with a frictionless desktop app and expand usage organically. Once teams rely on it, enterprise deals follow.

—
Slide 14 — Traction (Prototype)
• Working prototype with:
  – Comprehensive audio capture of all participants (no visible bot)
  – Real-time transcription with local-first engines and optional cloud
  – Live Mode with instant answers to questionable commands
  – Action-item extraction and live UI
  – Premium desktop UX
• Early user interviews positive on privacy & invisibility
• Upcoming: cross-platform loopback, model routing UI, admin policies

Speaker Notes:
We have a credible prototype demonstrating our core value. Feedback consistently highlights privacy, invisibility, and the polished feel.

—
Slide 15 — Roadmap (Next 12 Months)
• Q1: Cross-platform loopback; packaging and auto-updates; telemetry (privacy-safe)
• Q2: Admin console, SSO, enterprise policy engine; on-prem model options
• Q3: Structured insights export (CRM, Jira); promptable meeting templates
• Q4: Compliance (SOC2 Type II), governance, premium analytics

Speaker Notes:
Execution is straightforward: harden capture, scale distribution, and unlock enterprise features. Compliance is a key milestone for enterprise deals.

—
Slide 16 — Technology & Security
• Local-first default; cloud optional with customer-provided keys
• Secure key handling with masked UI fields and least-privilege access
• Data handling: ephemeral transcripts unless opted into storage
• Architecture supports on-prem deployment for regulated customers

Speaker Notes:
Security and privacy are designed-in: We never require sending audio off-device. When customers opt-in, they maintain key custody and tenancy.

—
Slide 17 — Financial Model (Illustrative)
• Pricing assumptions:
  – Pro: $15–$25/user/month
  – Team: $30–$45/user/month
  – Enterprise: volume pricing; optional managed minutes
• COGS:
  – Local inference ≈ near-zero marginal cost
  – Cloud ASR minutes billed at negotiated rates; passed through with margin
• Gross margin target: 75–85% at scale

Speaker Notes:
Local inference keeps margins high. Cloud minutes are variable COGS but can be priced with margin, and many customers will remain local-first.

—
Slide 18 — The Ask
• Raise: $1.5M–$2.5M seed to reach GA in 12 months
• Use of Funds:
  – Engineering: cross-platform capture; enterprise features; security
